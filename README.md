# Sobriety
## Hosted <a href="https://sobriety.vercel.app/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>

Super minimalist application to keep tabs on how sobriety & how long you've been sober. Wanted to make this for myself and others that may be having issues staying sober from certain things.

Not fully fleshed out of course, but...
## Expected Features To Come
- **Authentication / Login** - To keep track of user info w/o having to pick the sobriety date every time
- **Visualizations** - Different visualization of how far the user has been sober. Charts, graphs, etc.
- **Miscellaneous** - Things to do to motivate being sober, such as: Watering a virtual plant for every day you're sober and watching it grow, adding a leaf to a tree and seeing it bloom with each passing day, etc.
